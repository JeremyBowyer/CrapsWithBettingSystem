# CrapsWithBettingSystem
A simple Command Line Interface (CLI) Python Craps game I created from scratch with pass line and odds betting.

Originally created in 2015 as a baseline for learning Python, I decided to go back through recently and update the code to be cleaner and more effective. Feel free to download and play with it as you learn the language.

If you'd like to branch, here are a few things that still need to be done:

1.Rules explaining the game.

2.Better overall control flow.

3.Raise exception errors for non-acceptable input (i.e. trying to type a string for a bet.)

4.*Advanced* - work the code into a GUI using a library like Tkinter or PyGame.
